# Neural Network from Scratch

This is a Python implementation of a simple neural network from scratch, without using any external libraries or frameworks. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear and concise example of how a neural network works, and to serve as a starting point for those who are new to deep learning.


## Requirements
Requirements
To run the neural network, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Arjun-Sivasankar/neural-network-from-scratch.git
```


Navigate to the root directory of the project:
```bash
    cd neural-network-from-scratch
```
Run the neural_network.py file:

Copy code
```bash
    python NeuralNetwork.py
```
This will train the neural network on a simple example and output the network's predictions.



## Customization

Customization
If you want to customize the neural network, you can modify the hyperparameters in the NeuralNetwork class. For example, you can change the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, output nodes, and learning rate.

You can also provide your own training data by modifying the inputs and expected_output arrays in the main function.
